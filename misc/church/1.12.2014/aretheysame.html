<h2>Answer:</h2>
<h1>"Foreordination is different from predestination."<br /><br />
"The problem is one of definition and interpretation. Many Christian churches regard the words predestine and foreordain as synonymous. However, our modern-day Church leaders have distinguished between them. Predestination is not a part of Latter-day Saint doctrine; foreordination is."<br /><br />

To Latter-day Saints, the idea of predestination is unscriptural. Not only does it deny what Paul and other prophets taught about agency, but it also limits God's love to only a select few. Elder Joseph Fielding Smith stated emphatically that "no person is ever predestined to salvation or damnation. Every person has free agency."  Similarly, the Book of Mormon prophet Jacob taught that "one being is as precious in [God's] sight as the other." <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/jacob/2.21?lang=eng#20">(Jacob 2:21.)</a></h1>
