<h1>Several scriptures refer to foreordination; they tell us that Abraham was "chosen" before he was born <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/abr/3.23?lang=eng#22">(Abr. 3:23)</a> 
and that Jeremiah was "ordained...a prophet unto the nations" before his birth. <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/jer/1.5?lang=eng#4">(Jer. 1:5.)</a>
